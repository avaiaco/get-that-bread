# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.


## Team Standards

### Decisions

Decisions will be made with a conversation between all leading team members, and a popular vote will determine if the decision is passed or not.

### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory for every class meeting. The excusable reasons for absence include: family emergencies, injury, illness, or other serious reasons unless a planned vacation was notified to the team members in advance. When you are absent, you must make sure that you are keeping up the team over Discord or email, as well as your weekly work. 

### Participation

Communication will all mostly be held over Discord, where there can be meetings, etc. all online. Over time, work will be dedicated to each team member, and work will also be distributed to the members based on their interests whenever possible. 

### Meeting Times/Locations

Meetings will be hosted as needed, and schedules will be shared between team members so that our meeting times align with one another. Meetings will be held over Discord unless there is something extremely important, then meetings will be held in the library in-person. 

### Agenda/Notes

Notes will be shared between team members using either Discord, a Google Drive, or something similar where we can all independently access information at will.

### Promptness

Notify other team members if you are late to class or meetings, as knowing where each other are and what is going on is important. 

### 305Soft Policy

No distracted use of technology is allowed, and all phones and laptops, etc. must be away during team meetings.

### Enforcement/Feedback 

The team will enforce its rules by holding team members accountable for their own actions/breaking the rules of conduct. We will give feedback per each pull request, as well as within team meetings, and give comments directly on GitHub, etc. 



## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
ava_iacobucci@.uri.edu, james_carr@uri.edu, jack.manni@uri.edu, and nplamondon@uri.edu.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
