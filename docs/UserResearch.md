# User Research

## Responses and Observations

Observation 1:
- **Observation:** A lot of users use the Apple App Store, not the Google Play Store.
- **Supporting Data:** 76.7% (23/30 as of 3/3/25) of our users picked the "Apple App Store" option when asked where they download apps.
- **Team Action:** Potentially investing in an Apple App Store license later on.

Observation 2:
- **Observation:** Most people did not know that you can write off the price difference of gluten-free food for taxes.
- **Supporting Data:** 96.7% (29/30 as of 3/3/25) of responses picked the "No" option when asked if they had known that you can write off the price difference of gluten-free food for taxes.
- **Team Action:** Due to most people not being aware of this, it means we should capitalize off of this fact when advertizing as if someone learns about it from our advertisement they would be more likely to use our app to write off the diffrence to avoid having to do it themselves.
