# User Research

## Responses and Observations

Observation 1:
- **Observation:** A lot of users use the Apple App Store, not the Google Play Store.
- **Supporting Data:** 76.7% (23/30 as of 3/3/25) of our users picked the "Apple App Store" option when asked where they download apps.
- **Team Action:** Potentially investing in an Apple App Store license later on.
