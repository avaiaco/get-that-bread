# A/B Testing Ideas

### Ava Iacobucci
**A/B Test Name**:  Simple versus complex sign up screen.

**User Story Number**: US1 (Account Creation)

**Metrics**:  Users signing up for the app/creating accounts.

**Hypothesis**: State your hypothesis for this A/B test
My hypothesis for this test is that if there is an easier on the eyes, more simple way of signing up, it will help the user not be dettered from the app due to being overwhelmed with the clutter in the very beginning, and give them a better impression of the app. Despite this not necessarily being a huge issue for our users, it can still likely make a difference on the amount of people willing to create an account for our app. 

**Experiment** - We will set up a new page for the users to access when logging in, where a small percent (no more than half) of our users will be able to have this different log in page where it is more simple and precise, both with design and color, and see who makes it through the login either quicker or more successfully. We will track the users that were active on the app to see if there is an increase or decrease in users coming in and viewing the home page. We may need to do further tracking like when the sign up/in buttons are pressed.

**Variations** - The main thing I want to test is simpler colors and a very basic, modern design compared to the gradient, etc. that we currently have. 

### Jack Manni
**A/B Test Name:** Login page asking user for username and password VS. login page asking user for email and password

**User Story Number:** US2 (Login)

**Metrics:** User logging into the app.

**Hypothesi:s** State your hypothesis for this A/B test.
My hypothesis is by providing the user an option to sign in with their email, as it will help the user in signing into their accounts faster and removes the risk of the user forgetting their username. By allowing the user to sign into their account via email, they don't need to remember their username. It also allows room for experimentation, as if a user doesn't remember their username, they can test signing into their account with their alternate emails, removing the need for the username. It also is more secure, as it dissuades hackers from trying to get into user's accounts just based on usernames.

**Experiment:** We will create a new login page for our app that asks the user for their email and password combination, where a small percent of our users in a certain region will see this change. We'll track the amount of users logging in and determine if after this change, there's a change in the amount of users signing in. We'll also track our daily active users.

### James Carr
**A/B Test Name**:  Side Bar versus Bottom Navigation Bar

**User Story Number**: US4 (Golden Path)

**Metrics**: User ratings, time spent on the app, time spent on each page

**Hypothesis**: I hypothesize that users will find either the sidebar or a bar at the bottom of the screen to be more accessible and easier to use than the other. The impact of this would be that the users would find it easier to navigate around the different pages of our app, preventing any frustration that may occur from a disorganized or hard-to-use navigation system, which would result in an overall more negative opinion/review of our app. This would most likely massively impact how likely people would be to repeatedly use the app as navigation is a core feature that everyone must use and interact with when using the app.

**Experiment** -  The experiment for this hypothesis would be to setup a navigation bar at the bottom along with the sidebar that we already have setup, and have it so 50% of the users see the sidebar and the other 50% see the bottom bar, so that each group only has one of the two with it affecting the overall Ui of the app as little as possible. We will check how many times the users interact with each and see if there is an overall pattern of one being used more than the other and if the time spent in the app has a noticeable difference.

**Variations** - The two variations to test would be the variation with the side bar and without the bottom bar, and a variation without the side bar and with the bottom bar.


**Variations:** I want to test a login page prompting the user with their email and password and a seperate page that prompts the user for their username and password.


### Nicholas Plamondon
**A/B Test Name**: Emphasized Google Sign-Up vs. Neutral Sign-Up Options

**User Story Number**: US1 (Account Creation)

**Metrics**: # of users completing sign-up, time to complete sign-up, sign-up method used (Google vs. manual email/password)

**Hypothesis**:
My hypothesis is that by visually emphasizing the Google sign-up option could see a higher sign-up rate, as it is much more convinent than manually entering everything and most people are pretty familiar with logging in via google. If empahsis is placed on this option over manual we could see higher retention during the onboarding process. 

**Experiment**:
To test we can have two different versions of the sign-up screen: In the control version, both sign-up options (manual email/password and Google) are presented with equal visual weight and placement. In the test version, the Google sign-up option is emphasized. This will include positioning the Google button at the top of the screen, possibly making it larger or using a more vibrant color, and maybe also adding supportive text such as “Fastest way to get started." Users would be assigned randomly and completion rates, time to complete, and which method users chose would be tracked. We’ll also optionally track short-term retention to see if one method correlates with better user engagement.

**Variations**: Variation A (Control): Sign-up screen presents both Google and manual email sign-up equally (neutral layout, stacked buttons) and Variation B (Test): Google sign-up button is emphasized in size, color, and position (top of the screen), with supporting text like “Recommended” or “Fastest way to get started.” Email sign-up is still available but appears secondary
