# A/B Testing Ideas

### Ava Iacobucci
**A/B Test Name**:  Simple versus complex sign up screen.

**User Story Number**: US1 (Account Creation)

**Metrics**:  Users signing up for the app/creating accounts.

**Hypothesis**: State your hypothesis for this A/B test
My hypothesis for this test is that if there is an easier on the eyes, more simple way of signing up, it will help the user not be dettered from the app due to being overwhelmed with the clutter in the very beginning, and give them a better impression of the app. Despite this not necessarily being a huge issue for our users, it can still likely make a difference on the amount of people willing to create an account for our app. 

**Experiment** - We will set up a new page for the users to access when logging in, where a small percent (no more than half) of our users will be able to have this different log in page where it is more simple and precise, both with design and color, and see who makes it through the login either quicker or more successfully. We will track the users that were active on the app to see if there is an increase or decrease in users coming in and viewing the home page. We may need to do further tracking like when the sign up/in buttons are pressed.

**Variations** - The main thing I want to test is simpler colors and a very basic, modern design compared to the gradient, etc. that we currently have. 

### Jack Manni
**A/B Test Name:** Login page asking user for username and password VS. login page asking user for email and password

**User Story Number:** US2 (Login)

**Metrics:** User logging into the app.

**Hypothesi:s** State your hypothesis for this A/B test.
My hypothesis is by providing the user an option to sign in with their email, as it will help the user in signing into their accounts faster and removes the risk of the user forgetting their username. By allowing the user to sign into their account via email, they don't need to remember their username. It also allows room for experimentation, as if a user doesn't remember their username, they can test signing into their account with their alternate emails, removing the need for the username. It also is more secure, as it dissuades hackers from trying to get into user's accounts just based on usernames.

**Experiment:** We will create a new login page for our app that asks the user for their email and password combination, where a small percent of our users in a certain region will see this change. We'll track the amount of users logging in and determine if after this change, there's a change in the amount of users signing in. We'll also track our daily active users.

**Variations:** I want to test a login page prompting the user with their email and password and a seperate page that prompts the user for their username and password.
