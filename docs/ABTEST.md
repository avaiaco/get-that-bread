# A/B Testing Ideas

### Ava Iacobucci
**A/B Test Name**:  Simple versus complex sign in/sign up screen.

**User Story Number**: US1 (Account Creation)

**Metrics**:  Users signing up for the app/creating accounts/logging in.

**Hypothesis**: State your hypothesis for this A/B test
My hypothesis for this test is that if there is an easier on the eyes, more simple way of signing up, it will help the user not be dettered from the app due to being overwhelmed with the clutter in the very beginning, and give them a better impression of the app. Despite this not necessarily being a huge issue for our users, it can still likely make a difference on the amount of people willing to create an account for our app. 

**Experiment** - We will set up a new page for the users to access when logging in, where a small percent (no more than half) of our users will be able to have this different log in page where it is more simple and precise, both with design and color, and see who makes it through the login either quicker or more successfully. We will track the users that were active on the app to see if there is an increase or decrease in users coming in and viewing the home page. We may need to do further tracking like when the sign up/in buttons are pressed.

**Variations** - The main thing I want to test is simpler colors and a very basic, modern design compared to the gradient, etc. that we currently have.
