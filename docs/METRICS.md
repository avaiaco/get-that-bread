- Metric 1: Through analyzing consumer surveys from users, we will implement an NPS questionare to persuade users into rating the features our app and their experience using it, which will provide us valuable insight in developing future releases.

## NPS Survey:

The Net Promoter Score data will be collected when the user fills out the rating survey when the button to "leave a review" is pressed. We have a specific section to avoid any popups that may deter users from pressing certain buttons or using the app, as sometimes ratings can be a bit frustrating, especially since our app is used for a specific purpose. In the future, we may add another rating for when the user clicks, or saves a certain amount of recipes on Get That Bread. The data will be stored within the ratings collection in Firestore Database.

## Adoption:

## Retention: 

## Active Users:

## User Location: 

The user location is a built-in Firestore Database collection where when a user creates an account, the general location (likely based off of IP) is tracked and displayed, which would show up as a certain country or continent on the map in our analytics. Get That Bread needs this data as we need to see where certain users are from to reflect the currency that they should be able to view in the app, or if we only have American users, which would require no change.
